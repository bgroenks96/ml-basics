    "### The Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models (HMM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden Markov Models are a way of modeling systems that have some kind \"hidden\" stateful process behind them. They are based on the Markov assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(s_t|s_1,s_2,...,s_{t-1})=P(s_t|s_{t-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Viterbi allows us to determine, given some set of observations ${y_1,y_2,...,y_T}$, the most likely sequence of states that generated those outputs (also called \"emissions\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our HMM as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $O = {o_1,o_2,...,o_N}$ be the *observational alphabet*, or the finite set of all possible observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S = {s_1,s_2,...,s_K}$ be the set of possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A = a_{ij}$ where $a_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ where $i,j\\in \\{1,...,K\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $B = b_{ij}$ where $b_{ij}$ is the probability of state $i$ \"emitting\" observation $j$ where $i\\in\\{1,...,K\\}$ and $j\\in\\{1,...N\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\Pi = \\{\\pi_1,\\pi_2,...,\\pi_K\\}$ where $\\pi_i$ is the prior probability of state $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We omit the formal specification of $O$ in the implementation below since it is not needed for the algorithm. We assume that all values included in the observation sequence $Y\\in\\{1,2,...,T\\}$, or more specifically,$Y\\in\\{0,1,...,T-1\\}$ when taking Python zero indexing into account.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we want to compute the probability of some sequence of observations $Y$ given some HMM $\\lambda$, we can do so as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(Y|\\lambda) = \\sum_S P(S|\\lambda)P(Y|S,\\lambda)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for performing this computation has three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Set all of the emission probabilities at $t_0$ to their priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every $i$, set $V_{i,1} = \\pi_ib_{i,y_1}$ and $Q_{i,1} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "For every $i$ from $2$ to $T$ and every $j$ from $1$ to $N$, find the most likely path so far up to $j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{j,i} = max_{1\\le k\\le K}(V_{k,i-1}a_{ij}b_{j,y_i})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_{j,i} = argmax_{1\\le k\\le K}(V_{k,i-1}a_{ij})$\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Reconstruct the best possible state sequence computed by the induction step.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Z_T = argmax_{1\\le k\\le K}(V_{k,T})$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $t = T -1,T - 2,...,1$ : $Z_{t-1} = V_{Z_t,t}$ and $S*_{t-1} = S_{Z_{t-1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: In the implementation below, $T_1$ is $V$ and $T_2$ is $Q$*"
